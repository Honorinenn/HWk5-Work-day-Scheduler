When the scheduler is openned, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
While scrolling through, the user is presented with time blocks for standard business hours (from 9AM to 5PM)
When the user views the time blocks for that day, each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
Past
Present

Then the user can click into a time block and enter an event
When clicked on the save button on the right for that time block, then the text for that event is saved in local storage
